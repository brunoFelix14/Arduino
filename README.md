> A personal knowledge base and project portfolio for everything related to the Arduino ecosystem.

This repository is my central hub for documenting my learning journey with Arduino and other microcontrollers. It contains a curated collection of notes, sketches, and projects from free courses, academic disciplines, and my own personal experiments.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The goal of this repo is to:
* **Organize** all my Arduino-related code and learning materials in one place.
* **Document** my progress and challenges.
* **Create** a portfolio of tangible projects.
* **Share** my work with the community (and future me!).

## 📚 Content

### 🎓 Free Courses
This section contains all the materials, notes, and code exercises from online courses (e.g., Udemy, Coursera, freeCodeCamp, YouTube tutorials) that I have completed or am currently studying.

* **[Directory: `01-Free_Courses/`](./FreeCourses)**

### 🏫 Academic Disciplines
Here I store all the relevant work from my formal education (university/college) related to embedded systems, IoT, and electronics. This includes lab assignments, lecture notes, and final projects.

* **[Directory: `02-Academic_Disciplines/`](./02-Academic_Disciplines)**

### 💡 Personal Projects
This is the most exciting part! A collection of my own custom projects, from simple sketches to more complex, integrated systems. Each project aims to be self-contained with its own `README.md` file, source code (`src`), schematics, and component lists.

* **[Directory: `03-Personal_Projects/`](./03-Personal_Projects)**
